Notification-System is a project which will help faculty to intimidate the  students about any important information like examination schedules,results, classes reschedule, any upcoming seminar and other information.
This information will be shared with the students through SMS.
It is possible that trough other platforms like whatsapp, sometimes information is missed due to network gliches or any other reason, due to which we adopted SMS for message sharing.
The project is built on django framework along with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as front-end framework
Along with this, we will be using Celery and Redis for task scheduling involved in it.
